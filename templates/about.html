            <p>Resource Match is dedicated to bridging the gap between vulnerable populations and the resources they need to thrive. We believe that by connecting beneficiaries with volunteers and donors, we can create a more equitable and supportive community for everyone.</p>
            <p>Our focus is on supporting people with disabilities, women with medical conditions, widows, and elderly citizens who often face significant barriers to accessing essential resources and services.</p>

            <h2 class="mb-4">Our Vision</h2>
            <p>We envision a world where no one is left behind due to lack of access to resources. A community where:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>People with disabilities have the tools and support they need for independence</li>
                <li>Women with medical conditions receive proper care and assistance</li>
                <li>Widows find emotional and financial support during difficult transitions</li>
                <li>Elderly citizens maintain dignity and quality of life as they age</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Through technology and human connection, we're building pathways to make this vision a reality.</p>
